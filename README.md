documentation in accordance with meetings and lessons

# Structure
Each meeting is in it's own folder. Feel free to go through the meetings and browse our previous projects.
If you want to download everything just click the download zip button on the side of the page.
If you want to make edits feel free to google for a tutorial on how to use github, it's one of the most popular version control tools in the professional coding community so you might as well get ahead of the game now :)
